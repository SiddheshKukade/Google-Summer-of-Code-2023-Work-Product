# Google-Summer-of-Code-2022-Work-Product

## Project Details : 

#### Organization : [The Palisadoes Foundation](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/)
#### Project Name : Refactoring Plugins to WebSockets & Implementing Advertisement feature
#### Problem Statement :  
There are a number of features that while useful are not absolutely necessary for the base Talawa app and would be better suited as plugins. The goal of this task is to refactor the existing plugins such as Newsfeed Advertising, Spam Mitigation, Inter-group Messaging, Analytics Integration, Check-ins functionality, etc. We recommended that you use our Plugin Guide. The scope of the Newsfeed Advertising and Spam Mitigation are given below. They can act as a template for the any additional plugins you wish to discuss with the mentors.

**Newsfeed Advertising**: Community organizations often rely on the support of local businesses. This plugin would allow companies to advertise on the mobile application newsfeed. The plugin must consider both inexperienced advertisers who will only provide an image or video, and those who are more experienced users of online platforms.
Features
The type of content and ways to upload and display it (product placement) must be considered.
The plugin must provide a comprehensive set of advertising campaign features.
Integration with other advertising platforms should be considered.


### Project Progress Tracker: https://github.com/orgs/PalisadoesFoundation/projects/11/views/1

## Issue and Pull requests :

## 1. Refactoring Plugin architecture by transitioning into websockets.
  The plugin in talawa application  works just like a browser extension works in a browser. The difference here is that the plugin store from which the plugin is installed is handled by the admin of that organization and are used by the members of the organization. The current implementation uses long polling which is not very efficient in terms of cloud costs. These API connections should be converted to use subscription to reduce the number of calls we have to make to server.

Here are list of issues and pull requests reagarding that
 ### Talawa Admin & Talawa Web
 
 #### Issue : 
 - [Feature Request : Adding Plugin Logic to the Talawa Mobile Web App](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/issues/975)
 
 #### Pull request: 
 - [Adding Plugin Logic to the Talawa Mobile Web App](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/pull/976)
 
 Summary: 
- As the plugin would be installed by default the admins should be prompted that they would be using everything or they can visit the store to disable no required features. To understand the context please refer to this video: https://youtu.be/9rBc9sdpLjM?t=513

- Changed a Plugin model schema to reduce the complexity in the code.
  -  Before:
      ```js
        const pluginSchema = new Schema({
        pluginName: 
        pluginCreatedBy:
        pluginDesc: 
        pluginInstallStatus: 
        installedOrgs: [],
      });
      ```
  -  After:
      ```js
      const pluginSchema = new Schema({
          pluginName: 
          pluginCreatedBy:
          pluginDesc: 
          uninstalledOrgs: [], /// containing list of orgs who've that plugin feature disabled.
        });
      ```
- Created a websocket server in Apollo GraphQL to allow to subscribe to socket events.
- Wtitten API to update and delete plugin recrods and accordingly notify the server via GraphQL subscriptions.
- Fixed some windows related run-time errors.

# Conclusion 
Throughout my Google Summer of Code 2023 journey. I have worked on different features including both front-end and back-end web devlopment. I also worked with new technologies like WebsSocket protocol.
I've worked with my mentors  [Tasneem Koushar](https://github.com/tasneemkoushar), [Dominic Mills](https://github.com/DMills27) , & [Peter Harrison](https://github.com/palisadoes) to design and implement these features like advetisement, adding default plugin data in database. We had bi-weekly meeting to dicuss and provide feedback on current progress of work that helped me a lot to quickly figure out my mistakes. I would also like to thank my mentors, org admins and other contributors for helping me to make the project possible. Palisadoes Foundation has a very supportive community that believes in helping each other to grow together.

Thank you [Google](https://github.com/google) for Organizing such a great opportunity. ðŸ’› ðŸŒž
